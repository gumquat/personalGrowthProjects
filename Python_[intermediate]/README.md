# Personal Goal:
The goal of this exercise is to the go through the entire 9h youtube video by doing the following:

    - Attempt to create each program without assistance in half an hour or less
    - If I get stuck, watch 5 minutes into the video to determine if my approach was sound
    - return from first step

The end result should assist in a developing a better 'System of Approach' to programming problems.
In my experience, a sound and organized Approach creates a smoother development path.
